        <h6>Welcome to the Intramurals Management System!</h6>
        <p>This manual will guide committees through the system features and processes:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Add Teams:</strong>
            <p>
              Before adding teams, ensure that a section, course, or strand has been created and registered for the team.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add Players:</strong>
            <p>Once teams are added, you can proceed to add players to their respective teams.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Create a Bracket:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Select a grade level first for Basic Education (Basic Ed) teams.</li>
              <li>Ensure all teams have been added before generating the bracket.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Schedule Matches:</strong>
            <p>
              Once the bracket is created, schedule all matches. Matches that still have incomplete teams will not appear in the match list.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Check Game Scoring Rules:</strong>
            <p>
              Before starting a match, ensure that you have reviewed the game scoring rules and configured them to suit your preferences. Additionally, set up the player statistics that will be used during the game.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Start Matches:</strong>
            <p>
              Matches can only be started 30 minutes before or after the scheduled time. If this window is missed, the "Start Match" option will be inaccessible.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Point System:</strong>
            <p>
              Points will automatically be awarded to the champion. Ensure the school admin has configured the point system for the school in advance.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Match List Features:</strong>
            <p>
              In the match list, you can notify players before starting a game. Once the game starts, the live scores will be displayed on the website. 
              After ending the game, the match results will be updated, and the win will be automatically added to the winning team. 
              Points will be distributed automatically once the bracket or tournament for that game is concluded.
            </p>
          </li>
